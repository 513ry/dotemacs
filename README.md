# If you use Emacs 29 upgrade to the new version of following documents

This is a fallback Emacs 27.x configuration. Although, it should work with
Emacs 25 or later.

I removed all the system- or version-specific code and left only support for the
technologies I currently use, for this version to serve as a clean state before
transition to **straight**.
